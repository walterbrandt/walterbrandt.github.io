Looking at a stat called Rtot, which basically means how good they are at stopping the ball on defense. The Twins were quite abysmal in this category in 2024 being third to last only to the Marlins and White Sox, who barely combined for 100 wins total last year.\n\n\nCode\ntwinsbatting25 &lt;- read_csv(\"2025twinsbat.csv\")\n\ntwinsbatting25 |&gt;\n  select(Player, H, RBI) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Player = \"Player\",\n    H = \"Hits\",\n    RBI = \"Runs Batted In\"\n  ) |&gt;\ntab_header(\n    title = \"The Importance of Byron Buxton\",\n    subtitle = \"If Buxton can stay healthy he can really help the Twins in 2025\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"By: Walter Brandt  |  Source: Baseball Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Byron Buxton\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Importance of Byron Buxton\n\n\nIf Buxton can stay healthy he can really help the Twins in 2025\n\n\nPlayer\nHits\nRuns Batted In\n\n\n\n\nRyan Jeffers\n23\n11\n\n\nTy France\n32\n19\n\n\nEdouard Julien*\n18\n8\n\n\nCarlos Correa\n25\n9\n\n\nBrooks Lee#\n15\n5\n\n\nHarrison Bader\n25\n13\n\n\nByron Buxton\n32\n17\n\n\nMatt Wallner*\n15\n3\n\n\nTrevor Larnach*\n27\n15\n\n\nWilli Castro#\n15\n5\n\n\nChristian Vázquez\n8\n2\n\n\nMickey Gasper#\n6\n3\n\n\nJosé Miranda\n6\n5\n\n\nDaShawn Keirsey Jr.*\n2\n0\n\n\nLuke Keaschall\n7\n2\n\n\nJonah Bride\n7\n3\n\n\nKody Clemens*\n2\n2\n\n\nJhoan Durán\n0\n0\n\n\nTeam Totals\n265\n122\n\n\n\nBy: Walter Brandt | Source: Baseball Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, Twins fans expect Byron Buxton to never finish an entire season due to him getting injured seemingly every year since he put on a Twins jersey. But what happens when he is in the lineup? As we can see, Byron Buxton leads the Twins in hits(tied with Ty France) and is also second in runs batted in. If he can just stay healthy Buxton will be a crucial assest to the Minnesota Twins. His batting and fielding ability is that of an elite player when he is healthy.\nAll in all, the Minnesota Twins are decent and not much more than that. This is due to subpar fielding, mediocre pitching and injuries. The Twins could be shaping up to have a great 2025, as they been heating up the past few weeks after a slow start to the season. If the Twins can maintain a sub-three earned run average, keep Buxton healthy and get better at fielding they should make a postseason apperance in 2025."

It doesn’t take a football guru to know that you need a good run game to open up the pass game. Not being able to break tackles and not running for many yards gives way for longer second downs, making it much harder for an offense to have prolonged drives, wearing out the opposing defense and giving your defense a breather.\nAs everyone knows Caleb Williams was hit a lot in his rookie season.

However Caleb Williams took a beating his first year, leading the league in sacks. Although he led the league by a decent margin other quarterbacks got sacked a lot as well. However, what is different for Williams is the amount of yards he lost by getting sacked.\nSure, Chicago’s offense isn’t all there. But they have a great defense, right?\n\n\nCode\nadvdef &lt;- read_csv(\"defadv.csv\")\n\nHurryPCT &lt;- advdef |&gt;\n  mutate(HrryPCT=gsub(\"%\",\"\",HrryPCT)) |&gt;\n  mutate(HrryPCT=as.numeric(HrryPCT))\n\n\nbearsadvdef &lt;- HurryPCT|&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Chicago Bears\")\n\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=HurryPCT, aes(x=HrryPCT, y=Hrry), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n   geom_point(\n    data=bearsadvdef, \n    aes(x=HrryPCT, y=Hrry), color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Hurry Percent\", \n    y=\"Hurrys\", \n    title=\"The Bears defense gives QBs too much time\", \n    subtitle=\"Chicago is in the bottom of the middle in hurrying the opposing QB\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Walter Brandt\"\n    ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n     data=bearsadvdef, \n    aes(x=HrryPCT, y=Hrry, label=Team)\n     ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen most people think about the Bears they think of the Monsters of the Midway and hard-nosed defense. However, in reality the Bears were really not that great on defense either. One thing to look at is their quarterback hurries and hurry percent. They rank somewhere in the bottom middle meaning that they give opposing quarterbacks too much time to make a decision leading to big plays.\nA bad offense and a promising, yet less than proficient defense definitely did not do Chicago any favors last year. When you can’t score it makes it hard to win. It also makes it hard to win when running backs can’t break tackles and an offensive line allows their rookie quarterback to get sacked 68 times. Add all of that on top of a mediocre defense and that is a recipe for an awful season."
