Fans would be let down after the Bears went on to go 5-12, finishing in last place in the NFC North. It is not all doom and gloom for Chicago, they did bad enough to get yet another top ten draft pick in this year’s draft.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\noffstats &lt;- read_csv(\"nfl24.csv\")\n\nbears &lt;- offstats |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Team == \"Chicago Bears\"\n  ) \nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=offstats, aes(x=reorder(Team, PF), weight=PF), fill=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=bears, aes(x=reorder(Team, PF), weight=PF), fill=\"orange\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Points For\", \n    title=\"Chicago's offensive struggles\", \n    subtitle=\"The Bears are at the bottom of the barrel for NFL offense\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Walter Brandt\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a lot of hype going into the 2024 season with what analysts said was one of the best wide receiver cores in the league with DJ Moore, Rome Odunze and Keenan Allen who the Bears traded for from the Chargers in the offseason. Although there were some flashes of promise last season it is clear that the Bears struggled heavily with their rookie quarterback and abysmal offensive line. The Bears finished amongst the worst teams in the NFL this year in terms of points for.\nIt’s tough to win when you can’t score. But why can’t the Bears seem to put points on the board?\n\n\nCode\nrushing24 &lt;- read.csv(\"rushing.csv\")\n\nbearsrushing &lt;- rushing24 |&gt; \n  filter(Team == \"Chicago Bears\") \n\neaglesrush &lt;- rushing24 |&gt; \n  filter(Team == \"Philadelphia Eagles\")\n\nvikesrush &lt;- rushing24 |&gt; \n  filter(Team == \"Minnesota Vikings\")\n\nlionsrush &lt;- rushing24 |&gt; \n  filter(Team == \"Detroit Lions\")\n\npackrush &lt;- rushing24 |&gt; \n  filter(Team == \"Green Bay Packers\")\n\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=rushing24, \n    aes(x=BrkTkl, y=YAC.Att, size=Yds), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=bearsrushing, \n    aes(x=BrkTkl, y=YAC.Att, size=Yds), color=\"orange\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=vikesrush, \n    aes(x=BrkTkl, y=YAC.Att, size=Yds), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=lionsrush, \n    aes(x=BrkTkl, y=YAC.Att, size=Yds), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=packrush, \n    aes(x=BrkTkl, y=YAC.Att, size=Yds), color=\"yellow\") + geom_point(\n    data=eaglesrush, \n    aes(x=BrkTkl, y=YAC.Att, size=Yds), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 28.4375) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 1.95) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n     data=vikesrush, \n    aes(x=BrkTkl, y=YAC.Att, label=Team)\n     ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n     data=bearsrushing, \n    aes(x=BrkTkl, y=YAC.Att, label=Team)\n     ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n     data=packrush, \n    aes(x=BrkTkl, y=YAC.Att, label=Team)\n     ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n     data=lionsrush, \n    aes(x=BrkTkl, y=YAC.Att, label=Team)\n     ) +\n labs(\n    x=\"Broken Tackles\", \n    y=\"Yards after contact per attempt\", \n    title=\"The Bears frail run game\", \n    subtitle=\"Chicago Ranks second to last in broken tackles, second to last in yards after contact\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Walter Brandt\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bears claimed De’andre Swift in free agency which had players and fans alike excited about a dual threat offense but there was not much of a threat, especially in the run game. The Bears were second to last in broken tackles with only 12. Chicago was also second to last place in yards after carry per attempt. It doesn’t take a football guru to know that you need a good run game to open up the pass game, not being able to break tackles and not running for many yards gives way for longer second downs, making it much harder for an offense to have prolonged drives, wearing out the opposing defense and giving your defense a breather.\nAs everyone knows Caleb Williams was hit a lot in his rookie season.

However Caleb Williams took a beating his first year, leading the league in sacks. Although he led the league in by a decent margin other quarterbacks got sacked a lot as well. However, what is different for Williams is the amount of yards he gave up by getting sacked.\nSure, Chicago’s offense isn’t all there. But they have a great defense, right?\n\n\nCode\nadvdef &lt;- read_csv(\"defadv.csv\")\n\nHurryPCT &lt;- advdef |&gt;\n  mutate(HrryPCT=gsub(\"%\",\"\",HrryPCT)) |&gt;\n  mutate(HrryPCT=as.numeric(HrryPCT))\n\n\nbearsadvdef &lt;- HurryPCT|&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Chicago Bears\")\n\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=HurryPCT, aes(x=HrryPCT, y=Hrry), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n   geom_point(\n    data=bearsadvdef, \n    aes(x=HrryPCT, y=Hrry), color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Hurry Percent\", \n    y=\"Hurrys\", \n    title=\"The Bears defense gives QBs too much time\", \n    subtitle=\"Chicago is in the bottom of the middle in hurrying the opposing QB\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Walter Brandt\"\n    ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n     data=bearsadvdef, \n    aes(x=HrryPCT, y=Hrry, label=Team)\n     ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen most people think about the Bears they think of the Monsters of the Midway and hard-nosed defense. However, in reality the Bears were really not that great on defense either. One thing to look at is their quarterback hurries and hurry percent. They rank somewhere in the bottom middle meaning that they give opposing quarterbacks too much time to make a decision leading to big plays.\nA bad offense and a promising, yet subpar defense definitely did not do Chicago any favors last year. When you can’t score it makes it hard to win. It also makes it hard to win when running backs can’t break tackles and an offensive line allows their rookie quarterback to get sacked 68 times. Add all of that on top of a mediocre defense and that is a recipe for an awful season."
